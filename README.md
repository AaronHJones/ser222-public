# Introduction
This repository contains public files for use in SER222 (Design & Analysis: Data Structures & Algorithms) taught by Professor Ruben Acuña at Arizona State University. This repository primarily stores sample source code used in the course. Much of the material comes from samples in *Algorithms* 4th edition by Sedgewick and Wayne.

Within each unit, files are ordered by appearance.
