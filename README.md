# Introduction
This repository contains public files for use in SER222 (Design & Analysis: Data Structures & Algorithms) taught by Professor Ruben Acuña at Arizona State University. This repository primarily stores sample source code used in the course. Much of the material comes from samples in *Algorithms* 4th edition by Sedgewick and Wayne.

Within each module, files are ordered by appearance.

## Fundamentals (modules 1.1, 1.2, 1.4)

### 1.2 Data Abstraction
* Counter.java - ADT for representing a counter.
* CounterTester1.java - tests the counter class for reference behavior.
* CounterTester2.java - tests the counter class for reference behavior.
* IncrementCounter.java - interface for a counter.
* Point2D.java - ADT for representing a 2D point.
* Point2DTester.java - tests the Point2D class.

## Sorting (modules 2.1, 2.2, 2.4)

### 2.1 Elementary Sorts
* Date.java - example of implementing Comparable for a complex type.
* SortPlatform.java - basic helper methods for implementing and testing a sorting algorithm.
* SelectionSort.java - selection sort implementation.
* InsertionSort.java - insertion sort implementation.
* ShellSort.java - shellsort implementation.

### 2.2 Mergesort
* TopdownMergesort.java - topdown mergesort implementation.

### 2.4 Priority Queue
* Date.java - see 2.1 Elementary Sorts.
* MaxPQ.java - implementation of maximum priority queue.
* MinPQ.java - implementation of minimum priority queue.
* TopM.java - finds the top M transactions in an input.
* Transaction.java - ADT for representing financial transactions.
